# lobot
Lobot is a cloud helper.

## SETUP ##
You need the AWS CLI tools. They can be conveniently installed via *pip*:
```
sudo pip install awscli
```

Afterwards, you'll need to get your access key and secret key. You can create
one in:
```
AWS Management Console -> IAM -> Users -> %YOURNAME% -> Security credentials
```

Please make your old key inactive.

Once you have it, execute the following in a terminal and follow the instructions:
```
aws configure
```
